The goal of testing nftables syntax highlighting was to 
automate as much as we can.

The stages of test are:

   1. Linter (vint)
   2. Syntax checker (nft -c -f)
   3. Vimscript syntax highlight checker (Vader)

We do testing by executing one of the following:

    make test  (tests everything)
    make test-linter (or 'make vint')
    make test-syntax
    make test-highlight
